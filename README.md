# Functions and Git Collaboration Class Assignment

This repository contains two Python assignments completed as part of the milestone challenge.

## Assignment 1: Speed Check Program

This program evaluates the speed of a car and gives feedback:
- If the speed is less than 70, it prints `Ok`.
- If the speed exceeds 70, it calculates demerit points. For every 5 km/s above the limit, the driver earns 1 demerit point.
- If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints `License suspended`.

Example:
- Input: `80`
- Output: `Points: 2`


## Assignment 2: Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individual's Net Salary by requesting:
- Basic Salary
- Benefits

It then computes:
- Payee (Tax)
- NHIF Deductions
- NSSF Deductions
- Gross Salary
- Net Salary

The program ensures accurate salary breakdown according to statutory deductions.
