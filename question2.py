# MILESTONE TASK
# Create a class called Payroll whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs basic salary and benefits. Create 5 different class methods which will calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

#Instructions were to primarily make use of functions

benefits = float(input("Enter your total benefits: "))
gross_salary = basic_salary + benefits
